    <h1>Want to make a Libercus story that will randomly send users to two or more <em>other</em> stories?<br/>Your time has come.</h1>
    <p class="lead">We know people like our stories. But what if they would like them better if we added more pull quotes, or rewrote them as a Q&A, or included a <a href="http://www.watson.ch/imgdb/0ff5/Qx,E,0,0,3000,1956,1250,815,500,326/2743755217521083">picture of David Hasselhoff</a>?</p>
    <p class="lead">Add links to already-published Libercus stories below and embed the resulting code on the Libercus page you'll actually be linking to from the homepage. The result: Controlled A-B testing that will hopefully give us useful insights.</p>
